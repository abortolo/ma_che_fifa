Football is the most popular sport in the world. It has millions of passionate fans, thousands of clubs and big stadiums in almost every city. It is also a huge economic business. Movements of billions of euros linked to the impressive number of fans attending the stadium and the billionaire rights of pay TV.
The question of how much football players earns is immediate, but at the same time is known that they earn a lot of money. A more interesting question is how much these players cost to their clubs, and an even more interesting question is: the price their clubs pay, the market value of the players is correct? Market prices may seem abnormal at first sight, but they are linked to the high economic interests of this sport. 
Thanks to machine learning we tried to determine the actual players’ market value. To achieve this goal, we used machine learning to predict the right values of the players through MLP (Multy-layer perceptron network) processing. The ultimate goal is to predict the right value of a player based on his characteristics compared to other players. Hence the most important variable in our analysis is “value_eur” that corresponds to the value in euros currency, we have tried to predict it based on the other variables. Salary, on the other hand, is not that important in our analysis. It is sad to admit, but here the player is considered not just a person but an asset to the owner club. So here it is not so important how much a player is paid, but how much it is worth to the club.
